Ruby-Assignment
===============

    All assignments were done with Theresa Becker as my collaborator unless otherwise noted.  Google, 
    Stackoverflow, and various websites were primary resources.  Received heavy help on attribute history, 
    cartesian product (as I liked the yield method better than my nested .each attempt), and noted 
    pieces here and there.
